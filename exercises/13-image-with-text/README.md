# `13` Image with Text

Before CSS existed, using tables was the only way possible to do some website layouts, is a very similar process to creating layouts on MS Office.

For example, to recreate this example you have to do the following:

1. Create a table with the attribute border="0".
2. Add row (tr) with 2 columns (td) inside.
3. The first column containing an image with the attribute height="150". 
4. The second one with the attribute valign="top" to move the texto to the top of the cell and also add some text inside: you can use this tool to generate fake text that looks like real text: http://www.lipsum.com/
  
# 📝Instructions 

Please follow the previous steps to recreate the example.
