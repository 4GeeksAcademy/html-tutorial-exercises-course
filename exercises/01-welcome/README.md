# `01` Welcome to the world of HTML 😆 !!

Hello, my name is Alejandro Sanchez [@alesanchezr](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr).

I have prepared this exercises for anyone interested in learning HTML from scratch, we will go over the following concepts:

1. Get familiar with most of the most popular HTML Tags.
2. Using the tags together to create a simple HTML Website.
3. Linking websites together using Anchors with Realive or Abolute paths.
4. The HTML audio and video tag.

## ➡️ incremental & ✔️ Autograded

- I've built the exercises incrementally, you should feel the progress little by little, and hopefully, the difficulty raising between exercises will never be too big to get you frustrated.
- All have been automatically graded thanks to [@haydavid23](https://github.com/haydavid23)
- The video solutions have been translated to spanish thanks to Daniel Machota [@d4rkm0nst3r](https://github.com/d4rkm0nst3r)
