# `06` New Window

On the `index.html` file there is an anchor (`<a>`) taking you to `google.com`:

```html
<a href="http://google.com">Click me to search on google </a>
```

What property should we add to this `<a>` anchor, if we wanted it to open in a **new tab** instead of redirecting the user?

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Make the anchor (`<a>`) open a new window using the `target` attribute.

## 💡 Hints:

+ Your code should be something like this:

```md
<a href="url" target="_blank">--Your text--</a> 
```
