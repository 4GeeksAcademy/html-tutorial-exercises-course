# `14` Video Tag

The `<video>` tag is used to include video content within a document.

> Note: You can read about video tags here: [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=html+video+tag](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=html+video+tag)

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use the `<video>` tag to include this video on the website: [https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/video/why-pair-programming](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/video/why-pair-programming).

2. The video must cover the entire website, for this we are going to apply a `width="100%"` and a `height="100%"`.

3. The video should play automatically, make use of the attribute: `autoplay`.

4. Make use of the attribute `muted` in order to play the video without any sound.

> Note: The video MUST NOT have controls: play, pause, etc.

## 💡 Hints:

+ Something like this should be your code.

```html
<video width="X" height="X" autoplay muted>
	<source src="here goes the URL of the video"/>
</video>
```
