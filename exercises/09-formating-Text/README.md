The way word processing works in documents is pretty standard, you always see the same stuff: Headings, bold text, paragraphs, quotes, etc.

HTML was meant to replicate that exact behavior. Here is and example of a typical document that can be replicated with HTML:

Now without the dots

![HTML preview](../.learn/assets/09-formating-text.png)

## üìù Instructions:

1. Please write the code to replicate the exact same styles with pure html, use headings, paragraph, strong, blockquote, ol and li.
