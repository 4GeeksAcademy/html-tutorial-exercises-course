		<p>Let's think for a moment of HTML tags as boxes that hold your content; they can contain text, images, and related media... Sometimes, you'll have to place boxes inside other boxes. In this case, those "inner" boxes are nested inside of others.

In other words, Nested Tags refer to adding a tag inside the same tag as an immediate child.</p></a>
