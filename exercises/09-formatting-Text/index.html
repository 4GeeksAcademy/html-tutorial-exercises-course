		<p>Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		<p>Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>
		<blockquote>
			A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking
			<br />
			- A.A. Milne, If I May
		</blockquote>
		<p>After all, new generations have these things in common:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the attention span of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ul>
